# Weather and Tide Project

Two users live at the coast and want to plan their days off.

User A likes to fish. When the weather is fine and the tide is high is a good time for them to go fishing.

User B likes to mudlark. When the weather is fine and the tide is low is a good time for them to go mudlarking.

User A wants to get fresh worms for bait. When the weather is rainy and the tide is low is a good time for them to go worming.

This project will access Weather, Tide, Geocoding APIs.

The users will input their schedule and the optimum conditions for their hobby.

## Potential issues

Many cities around the world share the same name (eg. Berlin).

Many cities are not coastal

Tide API's are an unknown quantity at present
